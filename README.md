Association between Red Cell Distribution Width and ICU Mortality of Sepsis Patients

They were my code for the extraction data in eICU-CRD database and statistical analysis in R. It was also my first project so the code maybe a little disorder. I learned a lot in this writing, and I will improve it next time.
Thanks for Alistair Johnson(@mit-lcp).
